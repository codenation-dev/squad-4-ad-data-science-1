## Usage
> Describe how to reproduce your model

Usage is standardized across models. There are two main things you need to know, the development workflow and the Makefile commands.

Both are made super simple to work with Git and Docker while versioning experiments and workspace.

All you'll need to have setup is Docker and Git, which you probably already have. If you don't, feel free to ask for help.

Makefile commands can be accessed using `make help`.


Make sure that **docker** is installed.

Clone the project from the analytics Models repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/<@github_username>/recommender_system_leads.git
cd recommender_system_leads
```
